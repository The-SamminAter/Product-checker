## TODO:

- [ ] Make prototype for new script
   - [ ] Make it use functions (if that'll work?)
      - [ ] Maybe a couple of different functions (one for each url scheme)?
   - [ ] Add or migrate all current checks to new script
   - [ ] Add the url name to the created document
   - [ ] Possibly add in controlled variations?
   - [ ] Differenciate from page down/check broken, user not found, and user found
