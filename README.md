# Product Checker - based on my userrecon_reborn

Made for a friend, but should work for most sites, and should work on most OSes

Scans are easy to add, check out the existing ones for info on how they work

Accepts a launch argument of how many seconds the script should wait before scanning again - if none is specified, defaults to five minutes

### To-do:

- Site presets/configs
- Config file
	- Reading from
	- User interaction (through the script)
		- Adding to (custom or presets)
			- Search and scrape the results?
		- Removing from
		- Setting max price (won't alert if in stock and over that value)
- Price stuff
	- Getting product price
	- Comparing product price to max (if it has one)
